# Migration Log

## Session 1: 2025-08-27

*   **Completed Tasks**:
    *   Fixed the `cargo.toml` file to allow the project to be built.
    *   Implemented the `do_hosp_chur` and `repair_zone` functions in `zone.rs`.
    *   Implemented the `get_ass_value` and `do_pop_num` functions in `sim.rs`.
    *   Implemented the `do_problems` function in `sim.rs` with stubs for helper functions.
    *   Added unit tests for all implemented functions.
    *   Added an integration test for the `step_simulation` function.
*   **Notes**:
    *   The simulation logic is partially implemented. More functions need to be ported from the C code.
    *   The test coverage is still low. More tests need to be added.
